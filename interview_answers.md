# Interview Answers
Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. These will not be counted as a part of your sprint score but will be helpful for preparing you for your endorsement interview, and enhancing overall understanding.

1. What are the main differences between a stateful and a functional component?

Stateful components involve changes to data (state) while functional components are focused on rendering to the DOM.

2. When does a componentWillMount function be called? What about a componentWillUpdate?

componentWillMount runs when the component renders, componentWillUpdate runs when the state changes.

3. Define stateful logic.

Stateful logic is made up of functions that change state.

4. What are the three step of creating a successful test? What is done in each phase?

The three steps are Arrange (render the component being tested), Act (simulate any user actions that are being tested) and Assert (check the results to see if the changes expected exist).
